h1. TouchScrollManager — touch (kinetic) scrolling for AS3 (Flash).

... because there was no descent available for AS3.


h3. Usage

See src_examples folder. E.g. https://github.com/fljot/TouchScrolling/blob/master/src_examples/views/GeneralExampleView.mxml


h3. Know issues

* Snapping on orientation/viewport size/viewport content size change is totally messed up
* Directional lock needs improvement
* Lack of ASDoc (current ASDoc comments may be totally inappropriate)


h3. Build

Build is powered by Ant.
1. Make your own build.properties out of build.template.properties by copying and renaming. Fix several path properties (like path to your Flex SDK, Android SDK, etc..).
2. If you are FDT user: set property user.ide to FDT to have faster compilation time and extra tasks like debugger and profiler. If you use other IDE — skip it, there's a fallback to mxmlc.jar in Ant tasks. If someone knows tasks for FB, IDEA, FD — feel free to add them.
3. Check available Ant tasks and run them.

Hint for compiling for iOS: do it through console interface (Terminal on MacOS) so that IDE would be free and usable. For example:
ant package.ipa -Duser.ide=none


h3. Credits

Pretty lot of code and comments from Adobe Flex spark Scroller. Still need to clean it out and put appropriate Adobe Flex team mentions.
